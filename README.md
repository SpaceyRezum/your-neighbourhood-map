# What's Cool in Your Hood App

The Neighborhood Map App (or What's cool in your hood) is an SPA (Single Page Application) with the purpose of helping users discovering cool places to visit around their neighborhood or any location they are interested in. These places can be filtered and favorited for next time use.

### Using the App

Type a location in the search bar in the top left corner of the page. If the map API finds the location you have entered (or if you have used an autocomplete suggestion), the map should load the top 30 places found nearby out of the FourSquare API.

You can navigate these places by either clicking on them in the suggestion list in the left side menu or by clicking on a map marker to get more information.

You can also use the filter function to re-run the FourSquare API call focusing, this time, on the category you have selected. 

Finally, you have the possibility to favorite locations by clicking on the star next to their name in the left side menu.
